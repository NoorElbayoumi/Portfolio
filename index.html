									<h1>Hello
									</h1>
									<p>
									Thank you for taking interest in my portfolio,<br />
									let me give you a warm welcome!</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Big-Data.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am a 21-year-old college student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro majoring in Information Systems & Supply Chain Management, my name is Nooreldin Elbayoumi, but you can call me Noor for short! I am in that exciting and somewhat nerve-wracking phase of life where the future is wide open, and anything is possible.

									<br> <br> From a young age, I was drawn to creative fields like animation, graphic design, web design, and game design. However, I soon discovered their intense oversaturation, leading me to explore alternative paths that could combine my passion for creativity.								</br>
								</p>
								 When I was introduced to statistics in high school, I thought it was rather interesting. I could gather data and make an interpretation of what the future could hold. From there, I did extensive research to find the perfect balance between using statistics and letting my creativity show. 

								<br> <br> <p>That's when I fell in love with data analysis. To me, it's the perfect balance between the logical, analytical side of my brain and the creative, artistic side. I enjoy collecting, cleaning, and validating data and presenting it in simple, user-friendly dashboards that help people or businesses make better, organized, data-driven decisions.

									<br> <br> As I near the end of my university studies, I am committed to continuing to develop my skills and experience in this field. I am excited to take on freelance projects, update my website, and connect with others who share my passion for data analysis.
									
									<br> <br> If you're looking for an upcoming data analyst who can help you turn your data into insights and actionable information, please don't hesitate to reach out. I would love to chat with you and see how we can work together to achieve your goals! </br></p>
